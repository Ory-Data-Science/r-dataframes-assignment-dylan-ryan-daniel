For this instance, our data is so small, I can simply calculate the expected values by hand and compare them to the output.
That being said, doing the same to a small section of a much larger file should be just as effective.
The length of the file is of little issue, you can simply sample values and run them through the code and 
making sure the output is accurate.  
If it works with one section of the data file, it ought to work with averything else, organized accordingly, of course.
